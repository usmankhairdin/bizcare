                    information and/or health information relating to you and
                    any family member who will be included on your application.
                    This information will be used by your chosen insurance
                    company, agent, HSA trustee or administrator, or
                    government-run exchange or entity to process your
                    application. Additionally, we may ask you to provide us with
                    your credit card, bank information and social security
                    number, which will be used by your chosen insurance company
                    or HSA Trustee or Administrator to process your application
                    or collect any fees associated with your application or
                    insurance premiums upon approval of your application. If you
                    apply through us for government health insurance subsidies
                    or for health insurance sold through a government-run
                    exchange, we will ask you for personal information,
                    including financial, tax filing and household information,
                    that we will pass on to government-run sites and entities
                    responsible for processing such subsidies and applications.

                    Any time you enter or provide personal information and
                    sensitive information (such as credit card number and social
                    security number) in our website, we encrypt it using Secure
                    Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology. SSL protects information as
                    it crosses the Internet. To support this technology, you
                    need an SSL-capable browser. BizCare Benefits recommends
                    using encryption at least as strong as the 128-bit
                    encryption available in browsers such as recent versions of
                    Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Google’s Chrome browser.
                    These browsers will activate SSL automatically whenever you
                    begin shopping for a plan on our website and when you return
                    to our website to complete an application.

                <p class="text-[20px]">
                    In most browsers, you will see either a locked padlock or a
                    key icon to indicate your session connection is taking place
                    via a secure server. This icon indicates you are visiting a
                    secure area within a website. If you need a strong
                    encryption browser, you can go to the Microsoft website or
                    the Google website to download the latest Internet Explorer
                    or Chrome browser. We do not recommend the use of beta
